## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.

- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.

- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.



## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No error handling for impossible scenarios.

- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.



Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.

- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.



The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"

- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"

- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```

1. [Step] → verify: [check]

2. [Step] → verify: [check]

3. [Step] → verify: [check]

```



## PROJECT WORKFLOW and TECH STACK:

Goal

Extract text + structured data from scanned/noisy + partially illegible PDFs with confidence scoring.



project workflow :

PDFInput

↓

[PaddleOCR] → Raw text + layout

↓

[Confidence Filter] → Flag words < 0.80 confidence

↓

[LLM Cleanup] → Fix OCR errors ("app1e" → "apple")

↓

[Structured GROUNDED Output] → Pydantic schema ready for retrieval

↓

[learning from feedback] → operator edits -> store pattern -> extract signal -> apply to next document
